Abstract report: ...diverse tecniche di classificazione e valutazione e diverse tecniche di clustering.

Other popular choices for TC include:
- Boosted Decision Stumps (One level decision tree);
- Logistic Regression;
- Naive Bayesian Methods;
- Lazy Learning Methods (k-NN).

There are two important aspects to Evaluate a classifier: Efficiency, which refers to the consumption of computational resources (training and classification), and Effectiveness (Accuracy), that refers to how frequently classification decisions taken by a classifier are correct.

In classification by sentiment, bag of words is not enough, and deeper linguistic processing is necessary.
