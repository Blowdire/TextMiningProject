Tasks to be accomplished:
- Text pre-processing (mandatory, task dependent)
  - Tokenization
  - Normalization
  - Stemming
  - Lemmatization
  - Stop-words removal
  - Additional pre-processing operations can be implemented
- Text representation (choose suitable representation (s) and explain the rationale behind this choice)
  - BoW (binary, tf, tf-idf)
  - Word Embeddings (word2vec, Glove, etc.)
  - Contextual Word Embeddings (BERT, etc.)

Core tasks (please select two at your choice):
- Text classification;
- Text clustering;
